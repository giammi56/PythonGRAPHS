Purity withers and dies!
Never return to the ones that provided!
I'm taken by the one I was saving!
We're left hanging alone here!
By Demons Be Driven!
Praying for his god to prevail!
To bleed cannot be taught!
I'd bust the punks!
Painful and untrue.
Never ending pain, quickly ending life.
I regret this, the hurting of you.
No more head trips!
Your news is old news!
It's time to spread the word!
What's wrong with their mind?
We've lived with past mistakes.
Educate, reinstate, educate!
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior.
Mind pollution!
He wouldn't be saved from hell.
Full of grief I scream at the wind!
Imprison myself.
I won't let you in to have a story to tell.
Things tend to drag me down.
Don't understand so they hate me now.
My fear grips the will of stone.
My grip fears I'll die alone.
I'd never submit to the ones I will not be like.
I still feel incomplete.
Friends are few and far between.
You have that 'smart ass' attitude.
It's time to stop the fiction.
Hard time is coming!
My time, your pain!
You think you own...
Most regular people would say it's hard.
Don't f$&k with this!
You ain't got the balls, son.
I crush your rush.
Respect, walk.
I think I heard a shot!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
Be yourself, by yourself.
Is there no standard anymore?
I've got more friends like you!
One step from lashing out at you...
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence?
Are you talking to me?
You cry to weaken friends that sympathize..
Walk on home, boy!
I'm screaming revenge again!
Been constantly so frustrated!
I've moved mountains with less!
My strength is in number.
There comes a time within everyone to close your eyes to what's real.
No comprehension to fail.
Like a knife into flesh.
F$&k you and your college dream.
Fact is, we're stronger than all.
Deep down stronger than all.
We've grown into a monster.
Becoming Godsize.
Perhaps through death my life won't be so bad.
You group of pitiful liars.
Your master plan transpired...
You've waged a war of nerves.
Can't be what your idols are.
You cry for compensation.
You can't crush the kingdom..
I ask you please just give us 5 minutes alone.
You can't burn me.
One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life.
Look at you now. You're broken.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons.
My soul for a goat, yet I'll outlive the old.
A bad trip, the emptiness.
At battle with a mass astrengent.
Brainwashed by me.
A fake god rests dead inside you.
System destroyed. Exposed and unployed.
A big f$&king joke.
Slaughter the pig, the self righteous king!
God is in your chest and faith kills what is precious!
Slaughtered.
I vent my frustration at you old man.
Promises made by a liar, drunken liar.
Now you pick up that splintered chair.
I won't lose a second of sleep for this...
Don't touch me. Ever again.
You never knew the answers to any of my questions, did you?
You made up all the answers to my unimportant existence.
You'll never be the father I am.
We're f$&king you back.
I was betrayed, one more day of my short life.
I was me, but you weren't you.
I don't think you belong in here, I feel I'm sick.
Don't ask because you know damn well where I've been.
In between my longing for torture!
The mix of kissing and bleeding.
Your flower has soured.
It's never love. Bloody touch.
Equal his displeasure now!
Arm yourself. A branch. A third arm.
Perverted handle!
Equal your displeasure now.
This is feeding what I am.
It's like salt poured into a deep, infected wound.
It's the type of pain you really dig and long for.
Rejection...
The nauseating stab.
A short fuse.
If there really is a god, then it's punishing me constantly.
This shit goes on and on...
A sociopathic plan.
Is drowning what I am.
The earth, a purple blaze.
And so we pass on by the crimson eye.
Truly, f$&k the world.
Invite mayhem!
This is f$&king loveless!
It's amazing you're alive.
It's times like this you pray for murder.
It's times like this you pray for never.
Filling veins with juice of chaos!
So, I'm done with saving you.
Agony is the price.
Domination consumes you!
It's a twisted fall!
It's a useless ploy.
Those words that stare...
It's domination pushed into living hell.
Grim construction grows.
Now I watch the falling rain.
Left in my misery...
It all seems so unreal.
What's within our plans for life?
Crucified for no sins.
Reverend reverend is this some conspiracy?
I must reverse my life.
I should've cried and spared myself some pain...
You left me incomplete.
The chance to save my soul..
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack...ughh!
Hand out some beat-downs!
Hardline, hardline after hardline.
On my people they took turns.
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn!
And now you do what they told ya!
Killing in the name of.
Those who died are justified, for wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites!
Some of those that work forces, are the same that burn crosses.
F$&k you, I won't do what you tell me!
Yeah, the movement's in motion with mass militant poetry!
In the right light, study becomes insight.
So called facts are fraud!
Lost the culture, the culture lost!
Ignorance has taken over!
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Here's the plan!
Step back, I know who I am.
The rage is relentless.
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies!
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies.
Bullshit that he learned in school!
This time the bullet cold rocked ya!
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda!
Blasted through ya head!
I give a shout out to the living dead!
You were mesmerised!
Cellular phones soundin' a death tone!
Turn ya to stone before ya realise!
They say jump, you say how high!
No escape from the mass mind rape!
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape!
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya...
Ya brain-dead!
A bullet in your head!
Know your enemy!
Born with insight and a raised fist!
Still in a room without a view..
Amp up and amplify!
Defy, I'm a brother with a furious mind!
Action must be taken!
We don't need the key, we'll break in.
I was born to Rage Against 'em!
Fight the war, FUCK the norm!
Now I got no patience!
So sick of complacence!
WHAT?! The "land of the free?"
I've got no patience now...
Time...has...come...to...PAY!!!
Yes, I know my enemies!
Compromise! Conformity! Assimilation! Submission!
Ignorance! Hypocrisy! Brutality! The elite!
Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list.
The militant poet in once again, check it!
They're sending us to early graves..
Don't turn away, Get in front of it!
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Yo, check the diagonal!
Doesn't that make it three in a row?
Anger is a gift!
Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero.
Freedom, Freedom, yeah right!
Weapons not food, not homes, not shoes!
Rally round tha family, pockets full of shells!
Bulls on parade!
Yeah, we better turn tha bass up on this one!
Now crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream..
But how you gonna get what you need ta get?
Pullin' knobs on the floor of their toxic metropolis..
It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
A world of violent rage!
Hatred passed on, passed on and passed on..
I gotta 9, a sign, a set and now I gotta name.
Death is on my side....suicide!
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip.
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane.
If ignorance is bliss, then knock the smile off my face!
No-one's here to catch me when I fall!
Caught between my culture and the system....genocide!
